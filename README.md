## Explainable Time Series

This repository contains the code and resources used for the dissertation project titled "Explainable Time Series" as partial fulfillment of the
MSc Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, submitted to The University of Nottingham in September 2024.
The study involves the application of various time series forecasting models spanning from naive, statistical to complex machine learning models followed by application of XAI techniques 
to understand their underlying decision-making process. The study revolves around five major Indian companies: Reliance Industries, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, IFB, and HDFC Bank.

### Highlights of the Dissertation

1. Mixed Approach: Utilization of both R and Python to leverage the strengths of each language, from statistical modeling in R to advanced deep learning techniques in Python.
2. Custom XAI Wrappers: Development of custom R code and wrappers to perform XAI analysis on Elman RNN, a model not well-supported by existing XAI libraries.
3. LIME Hypothesis Investigation: A focused study on the LIME hypothesis, exploring the deteriorating fit of LIME explanations as the value of input features increases.
4. Comprehensive XAI Comparison: A thorough comparison of multiple XAI techniques across different models, offering a deeper understanding of how each model interprets and utilizes features in making predictions.
